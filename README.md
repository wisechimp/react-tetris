A Tetris clone built with React.</br>

[Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) is a puzzle video game first released in 1984. This version is based on a free Udemy course React Tetris with hooks, which has since been discontinued. The videos have been transferred over to [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0jpcQ5lO0nEH2BpPmJhePz_urgyAljFB) for those who would like to build it themselves.
